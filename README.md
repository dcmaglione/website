# website
Personal website built and designed from scratch using React and Tailwind CSS.

## Description
This website was completed over Summer '22 as a chance to finally refresh my old website from Summer '21. Rather than being based off a template like my old website, this new site was designed and created from scratch with a more minimalistic vision. I am not a web developer and certainly not a UI/UX designer, so this website was a challenge to myself to escape my comfort zone.

## Installation
This website is written using React and Tailwind CSS. For development, ensure your system has npm installed.
To install all necessary packages run the following inside the project directory:
```
npm install
```

## Usage
Run all of the following inside the project directory.
To start the development server run the following:

```
npm start
```

To create a build directory with a production build of the website run:
```
npm build
```

## Contributing
These source files are open to contribution and criticism. I use this website to not only display my skills but convey them as well.

## Project Status
Contribution and development for this respository is currently in progress.
